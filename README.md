# loanpred
In this project, we are going to implement a Loan Approval Prediction system. This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. A few examples of classification problems are Spam Email detection, Cancer detection, Sentiment Analysis, etc.
